# Animal Image Classification

A deep learning web application that classifies animal images into 15 categories using a fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model. Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, and deployable on Hugging Face Spaces.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates image classification using transfer learning. Users can upload an image, and the app predicts the animal category with a confidence score.

---

## Features

- **Transfer Learning**: EfficientNetB0 model trained on a labeled animal image dataset.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload and classify images.
- **Ready for Deployment**: Easily deployable to Hugging Face Spaces.

- Bear
- Bird
- Cat
- Cow
- Deer
- Dog
- Dolphin
- Elephant
- Giraffe

## Deploy to Hugging Face

1. Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Click **Create new Space** → Choose **Streamlit** and **Python**
3. Upload:
   - `app.py`
   - `efficientnetb0_best.h5`
   - `requirements.txt`

4. The app will auto-deploy once all files are uploaded.
